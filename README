# My-Website
## By Kyeisha Simpson
This is a website for my final project
## TODO
Add more images
#Remove the background from the photos
Add some colors to the text
##Classmate suggestions
1. Gallery/Photo Gallery - when on the homepage it says gallery. When on the about page it says Photo Gallery. I would pick one or the other for consistency through out the website. 
2. On the About page, Strawberryland seems to be left by itself when first looking through the website. I know it is supposed to be apart of the picture. If you could get the text to be closer to the picture it would be awesome!
