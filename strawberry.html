    <h2>Who Created Strawberry Shortcake?</h2>
    <p>Strawberry Shortcake was originally created in 1977 by <a
            href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/meet-tulsa-resident-muriel-fahrion-the-creator-of-strawberry-shortcake">Muriel
            Fahrion,</a> an illustrator working for American Greetings. What began as a simple greeting card character
        quickly blossomed into a beloved franchise featuring dolls, cartoons, books, and more.
        Muriel Fahrion gave Strawberry her signature look: red hair, freckles, a big bonnet, and of course, her
        strawberry-themed dress. Fahrion also designed many of Strawberry’s friends, helping shape the colorful world of
        Strawberryland.
        The character's early popularity led to a successful toy line produced by Kenner and a series of animated
        specials in the 1980s that many fans still cherish today.</p>
